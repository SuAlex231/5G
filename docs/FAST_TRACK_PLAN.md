## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Quick-Launch Optimizations

1. **Single-Machine Deployment**
   - Docker Compose for simple orchestration
   - Localhost defaults for immediate usability
   - Volume persistence for data retention

2. **Simplified Authentication**
   - JWT tokens for stateless authentication
   - Role-based permissions without complex claims
   - Seed script for immediate admin access

3. **Practical OCR Integration**
   - CPU-based PaddleOCR for cost efficiency
   - Async processing to prevent UI blocking
   - Configurable heuristics for field mapping

4. **Pragmatic File Management**
   - MinIO for S3-compatible object storage
   - Pre-signed URLs for secure access
   - Automatic bucket creation

### Scalability Considerations

1. **Database Design**
   - JSONB for flexible ticket schemas
   - Indexed commonly queried fields
   - Audit trail for compliance

2. **API Architecture**
   - RESTful design with OpenAPI documentation
   - Pagination for large datasets
   - Filtering and search capabilities

3. **Frontend Performance**
   - Component lazy loading
   - Optimized image handling
   - Efficient API request patterns

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **OCR Accuracy**
   - **Risk:** Chinese text recognition may be inconsistent
   - **Mitigation:** Manual override capabilities, confidence scoring

2. **Excel Import Complexity**
   - **Risk:** Varied Excel formats may cause import failures
   - **Mitigation:** Fuzzy matching, detailed validation reports

3. **Docker Resource Usage**
   - **Risk:** Services may overwhelm single-machine deployments
   - **Mitigation:** Resource limits, monitoring, optimization

### Business Risks

1. **User Adoption**
   - **Risk:** Complex interface may hinder adoption
   - **Mitigation:** Intuitive UI design, default admin credentials

2. **Data Migration**
   - **Risk:** Existing data may be lost during deployment
   - **Mitigation:** Clear backup procedures, migration scripts
